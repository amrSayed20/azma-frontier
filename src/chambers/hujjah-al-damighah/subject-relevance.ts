 * AZMA OS — Al Hujjah Al-Damighah
 *
 * Does this passage bear on what the Creator actually asked?
 *
 * ─── WHY COUNTING WORDS WAS NEVER GOING TO BE ENOUGH ────────────────────────
 *
 *   Retrieval finds passages that carry a word. That is all it can do, and it
 *   is the right thing for it to do: thirty-six thousand narrations cannot be
 *   read one by one for every question.
 *
 *   But a word is not a subject. The Founder asked for the story of Yunus ﷺ and
 *   was handed the verse, and then every narration transmitted by a man named
 *   Yunus, and then a Yemeni singer who happens to share the name. Separating
 *   the chain of transmission from what was narrated removed the transmitters.
 *   It does nothing about the singer, and nothing about «مقام النبي دانيال»
 *   arriving as evidence for a question about الصبر.
 *
 *   «يجب أن تكون الحجرة صادقة وتجيب المستخدم من سؤاله أو موضوعه الذي قد حدده
 *    مسبقاً» — and a chamber that hands over ten passages, six of which are
 *    about something else, is not answering the subject. It is answering the
 *    spelling.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THIS DOES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   Retrieval stays as it is and finds candidates. Then the candidates are read
 *   — all of them, in one pass — and each is judged on one question only: does
 *   this bear on the subject asked about? What does not is set aside, and the
 *   Creator is told how many were set aside rather than left to wonder why ten
 *   became four.
 *
 * ─── WHAT IT MUST NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   It does not rank, grade, interpret, or rule. It does not decide that a
 *   narration is weak or that a verse does not apply — those are judgements
 *   about standing and meaning, and they belong to the authority policy and to
 *   scholars respectively. It decides only whether a passage is on the subject
 *   at all, which is the question retrieval could not ask.
 *
 *   And it fails open. When it cannot read, everything retrieved is kept: a
 *   Creator holding extra evidence can see for themselves that a passage is off
 *   the subject, while a Creator holding none because a judge was unreachable
 *   has been silently denied what the Empire actually found.
